
- Simple Sorter is a task list which I created using dart, it allows the user to capture and organize tasks the moment they pop into their head, it also give the users the ability to categorize tasks.
- I managed a Sqflite database to store and display the for the tasks the user put in.
- Implemented the frontend using a number of flutter widgets.
